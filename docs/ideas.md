* I wish we could add village/city names on different parts of the island(s) sometimes I’ll change for example the high school or PD/FD name but I’m talking more in depth.

It was fun but the lack of cars thing kills it for me. Building something away from your city takes 10-20 minutes because the builders walk so slowly and then head home to eat quickly. This problem compounds in so many ways from Teamsters to productivity losses at factories. Everything needs to be super dense. The only way I could build an airport was to build a construction yard right next to it.
